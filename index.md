# UH Manoa Student Book Market for ICS Students

## About ICSBookMarket

The ICS Book Market allows the students of UHM to buy and sell books with each other. Buyers can search for books and message sellers to set up a transaction. Sellers can create listings for books they want to sell, and make it easy for buyers to contact them if they are interested in a book a seller has listed. What makes this application unique is that it's only available to the students of UHM and will be particularly useful for students within the ICS department or students who wish to learn material relevant to the ICS field of study. This application is exclusive to holders of myUH accounts.  Such localization may serve to avoid potential issues that buyers may be faced with when using other general or less specified markets to buy or sell products through.
